- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - Static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [Crypto-JS] - JavaScript library of crypto standards { NOT MANTAINED ANYMORE, NEED TO FIND A REPLACEMENT }


Currently not in use but soon will be:
- [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) - Delightful JavaScript Testing
